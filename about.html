    <p>To Be honest, I am very scared of the winter time. You can see where I come from with the image above. I am not built well for this type of environment, a lot of my friends here say that it isn't that bad but I really just don't believe them! Does that make me a bad friend? Anyways, I am a lot more familiar to the warm days and the humid nights 24/7 rather than the dry cold nights that await me, I truly wonder how the snow will feel like, I know it is made out of water, but I can assume that it has a different type of feeling in your hand, obviously cold, but I just wonder how it will truly feel. As I sit here with the window open allowing the fresh breeze, I must admit that this breeze is getting a bit too “fresh” if you can call it that. Back home we would open windows and doors to get the heat out of the house and allow in the fresh Caribbean air to fill the house with the smell of freshness from the orchard and the salt from the sea. Here I predict myself closing more windows than usual, and inviting the nasty smell of my roommate’s disgusting deodorant into my poor nostrils.</p>
