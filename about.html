    <p>Hello folks my name is Juanqui! It is a pleasure to meet you all. I am originally from Puerto Rico, the north side of the island to be more accurate. I live very close to the beach so I am always either sporting a cool tan or a nasty sunburn, either or, never in between. I grew up near the water so I am most at home in the water. I used to surf with my entire family, snorkel with my siblings, and have sleepovers on the beach. It was super fun, but I wanted to pursue my dreams of working in the tech industry. I left my paradise to go to the north to study computer science. </p>
